# Coronavirus COVID-19 Dashboard

## Overview

This map shows the worldwide location of Coronavirus COVID-19 outbreak. The data the maps consumes comes from [Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Cases, provided by JHU CSSE](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19). We do not own the data source and suggest using any data source of your choice.

The map is based on [Microsoft Azure Maps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/azure-maps/). **You must obtain an Azure Maps key in order to display the map. See the instructions at the beginning of this tutorial [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-maps/quick-demo-map-app).**
